Over two weeks in January, Bottom and 71 other engineers and technicians assigned to the 2020 mission took over the High Bay 1 cleanroom in JPL\\'s Spacecraft Assembly Facility to put the software and electrical systems aboard the mission\\'s cruise, entry capsule, descent stage and rover through their paces.   </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"ST1 was a massive undertaking,\" said Bottom. \"It was our first chance to exercise the flight software we will fly on 2020 with the actual spacecraft components that will be heading to Mars &mdash; and make sure they not only operate as expected, but also interact with each other as expected.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The heritage for Mars 2020\\'s software goes back to the Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) and the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars\\' Gale Crater since 2012. But 2020 is a different mission with a different rover, a different set of science instruments and a different destination on Mars. Its software has to be tailored accordingly. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Work began in earnest on the flight software in 2013. It was coded, recoded, analyzed and tested on computer workstations and laptops. Later, the flight software matriculated to spacecraft testbeds where it was exposed to computers, sensors and other electronic components customized to imitate the flight hardware that will launch with the mission in  2020.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"Virtual workstations and testbeds are an important part of the process,\" said Bottom. \"But the tens of thousands of individual components that make up the electronics of this mission are not all going to act, or react, exactly like a testbed. Seeing the flight software and the actual flight hardware working together is the best way to build confidence in our processes. Test like you fly.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Making the Grade</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the day before ST1 began, the High Bay 1 cleanroom was hopping with \"bunny suit\"-clad engineers and technicians assembling, inspecting and testing the mission\\'s hardware. The next day, Wednesday, Jan. 16, the room was eerily quiet. The majority of workers had been replaced by two technicians there to monitor the flight test hardware. Lines of electrical cabling &mdash; \"umbilicals\" &mdash; were added to provide data and power to the spacecraft\\'s cruise stage, back shell, descent stage and rover chassis, which have yet to be stacked together. The ground to in-flight spacecraft (and in-flight spacecraft to ground) communications were handled by X-band radio transmission, just like they would be during the trip to Mars. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>ST1 began with commands to energize the spacecraft\\'s electrical components and set up thermal, power and telecom configurations. While all the spacecraft components remained in the cleanroom, Bottom and her team had them thinking they were sitting on top of an Atlas 541 rocket 190 feet (58 meters) above Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral on July 17, 2020, waiting to be shot into space. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Next, they focused on another part of cruise before testing the landing sequence. Then they did it all over again. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After a successful launch, they time jumped 40 days ahead to simulate deep space cruise. How would the software and hardware interact when they had to perform navigation fixes and trajectory correction maneuvers? And how would they work when simulated events didn\\'t go as planned? The team looked for answers on the operators\\' computer screens in the test operations room beside the cleanroom. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"From the test operations room, you could look out the windows onto the cleanroom floor and clearly see the flight hardware,\" said Bottom. \"Nothing was visibly moving, but underneath the outer structure, there were flight computers swapping sides, radios sending and receiving transmissions, fuel valves moving in and out, subsystems being energized and later turned off, and electrical signals being sent to nonexistent pyrotechnic devices. There was a lot going on in there.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On Jan. 30, the Mars 2020 test team was able to close their 1,000-plus page book of procedures for ST1. They went two-for-two on Mars landings. They also launchedfour times, performed deep space navigation, executed several trajectory correction maneuvers and even tested a few in-flight off-nominal situations.This first evaluation of flight hardware and software, over a year in the making, had been a thorough success, demonstrating where things excelled and where they could be improved. When these new changes have been investigated on both a virtual workstation and in the testbed, they will have their chance to \"fly\" in one of the many other systems tests planned for Mars 2020. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\"One of the future scenario tests will place the rover inside a thermal chamber and simulate being on the surface. It will step through mission critical activities at some very low Mars surface temperatures,\" said Bottom. \"Both literally and figuratively it will be a very cool test.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Mars 2020 Project at JPL manages rover development for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

The rover has been climbing Mount Sharp since 2014 and recently reached a clay region that may offer new clues about the ancient Martian environment\\'s potential to support life.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity encountered a hurdle last Friday, when a hiccup during boot-up interrupted its planned activities and triggered a protective safe mode. The rover was brought out of this mode on Tuesday, Feb. 19, and is otherwise operating normally, having successfully booted up over 30 times without further issues.</p>\\n\\n<p>Throughout the weekend, Curiosity was sending and receiving technical data, communicating with the team in order to help them pinpoint the cause of the issue.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'re still not sure of its exact cause and are gathering the relevant data for analysis,\" said Steven Lee, Curiosity\\'s deputy project manager at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

He added that the team wants to hold off from further hammering for about two weeks.</p>\\n\\n<p>Data show that the probe itself continues to function as expected: After heating by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit, it measures how quickly that heat dissipates in the soil. This property, known as thermal conductivity, helps calibrate sensors embedded in a tether trailing from the back of the mole. Once the mole is deep enough, these tether sensors can measure Mars\\' natural heat coming from inside the planet, which is generated by radioactive materials decaying and energy left over from Mars\\' formation.</p>\\n\\n<p>The team will be conducting further heating tests this week to measure the thermal conductivity of the upper surface. They will also use a radiometer on InSight\\'s deck to measure temperature changes on the surface. Mars\\' moon Phobos will pass in front of the Sun several times this week; like a cloud passing overhead, the eclipse will darken and cool the ground around InSight.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more details, visit DLR\\'s blog:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/blogs/en/desktopdefault.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.dlr.de/blogs/en/desktopdefault.aspx</a></p>\\n\\n<p>For more information about InSight, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/\">https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Relations Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

Check for yourself: Starting today, the public can get <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/\">a daily weather report</a> from NASA\\'s InSight lander.</p>\\n\\n<p>This public tool includes stats on temperature, wind and air pressure recorded by InSight. Sunday\\'s weather was typical for the lander\\'s location during late northern winter: a high of 2 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius) and low of -138 degrees Fahrenheit (-95 degrees Celsius), with a top wind speed of 37.8 mph (16.9 m/s) in a southwest direction. The tool was developed by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, with partners at Cornell University and Spain\\'s Centro de Astrobiolog&iacute;a. JPL leads the InSight mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>Through a package of sensors called the Auxiliary Payload Subsystem (APSS), InSight will provide more around-the-clock weather information than any previous mission to the Martian surface. The lander records this data during each second of every sol (a Martian day) and sends it to Earth on a daily basis. The spacecraft is designed to continue that operation for at least the next two Earth years, allowing it to study seasonal changes as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>The tool will be geeky fun for meteorologists while offering everyone who uses it a chance to be transported to another planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It gives you the sense of visiting an alien place,\" said Don Banfield of Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, who leads InSight\\'s weather science. \"Mars has familiar atmospheric phenomena that are still quite different than those on Earth.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Constantly collecting weather data allows scientists to detect sources of \"noise\" that could influence readings from the lander\\'s seismometer and heat flow probe, its main instruments. Both are affected by Mars\\' extreme temperature swings. The seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), is sensitive to air pressure changes and wind, which create movements that could mask actual marsquakes.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"APSS will help us filter out environmental noise in the seismic data and know when we\\'re seeing a marsquake and when we aren\\'t,\" Banfield said. \"By operating continuously, we\\'ll also see a more detailed view of the weather than most surface missions, which usually collect data only intermittently throughout a sol.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>APSS includes an air pressure sensor inside the lander and two air temperature and wind sensors on the lander\\'s deck. Under the edge of the deck is a magnetometer, provided by UCLA, which will measure changes in the local magnetic field that could also influence SEIS. It is the first magnetometer ever placed on the surface of another planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight will provide a unique data set that will complement the weather measurements of other active missions, including NASA\\'s Curiosity rover and orbiters circling the planet. InSight\\'s air temperature and wind sensors are actually refurbished spares originally built for Curiosity\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/instruments/environsensors/rems/\">Rover Environmental Monitoring Station</a> (REMS).

But it could also be used, along with InSight\\'s cameras, to study how much dust and sand blow around. Scientists don\\'t know how much wind it takes to lift dust in Mars\\' thin atmosphere, which affects dune formation and dust storms &mdash; including planet-encircling dust storms like the one <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8354/storm-chasers-on-mars-searching-for-dusty-secrets/\">that occurred last year</a>, effectively ending the Opportunity rover\\'s mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>APSS will also help the mission team learn about dust devils that have left <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22199/of-wind-and-dust-devils-on-mars/?site=insight\">streaks on the planet\\'s surface</a>. Dust devils are essentially low-pressure whirlwinds, so InSight\\'s air pressure sensor can detect when one is near. It\\'s highly sensitive &mdash; 10 times more so than equipment on the Viking and Pathfinder landers &mdash; enabling the team to study dust devils from hundreds of feet (dozens of meters) away.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Our data has already shown there are a lot of dust devils at our location,\" Banfield said. \"Having such a sensitive pressure sensor lets us see more of them passing by.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

It was the first rover to identify and characterize sedimentary rocks on a planet other than Earth. Opportunity\\'s measurements showed these rocks formed in ancient ephemeral playas. Opportunity also discovered small spheres of hematite nicknamed \"blueberries\" that formed late from rising, acidic groundwater. Once Opportunity reached the rim of Endeavour crater, the rover found white veins of the mineral gypsum &mdash; a telltale sign of water that traveled through underground fractures. Opportunity also found more compelling signs of Mars\\' watery past in the rocks of Endeavour Crater: clay minerals that formed in neutral-pH (not too acidic, not too basic) water. Of all the places studied by Opportunity, the environment at Endeavour had the friendliest conditions for ancient microbial life.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p><b>3. Opportunity is an off-world record holder.</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Opportunity worked longer on the surface of Mars than any other robot &mdash; more than 14 years.

Opportunity was the little rover that could.</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Opportunity didn\\'t survive for over 14 years because its mission was easy. It encountered challenges that required its engineers to be resourceful. For instance, the rover\\'s right-front wheel sometimes drew more current than the other wheels, so engineers often drove the rover backward to extend the right front wheel\\'s life.</p>\\n\\n<p>The terrain was treacherous. After the rover landed at Eagle Crater, its wheels slipped on the loose slopes when it first attempted to drive out of the crater. Rover planners had to come up with creative driving strategies to get out &mdash; something they did again at Endurance Crater, where slopes were as steep as 31 degrees. On April 26, 2005, Opportunity\\'s wheels dug into a soft, wind-sculpted sand ripple and got stuck for several nail-biting weeks at \"<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/5855/looking-back-at-purgatory-dune/\">Purgatory Dune</a>.\" But after extensive testing in a Mars-like sandbox at JPL, the team was able to carefully shimmy out of the Martian sand trap.</p>\\n\\n<p>Opportunity encountered two mission-threatening dust storms that blocked sunlight from reaching its solar panels. It survived a <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20070907a.html\">dust storm in 2007</a> by minimizing activities and maintaining enough power in its batteries to recover when the skies cleared. Unfortunately, the 2018 dust storm blotted out even more sunlight and kept the skies above Opportunity dark about a month longer.</p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/internal_resources/details/original/480_PIA18394-web.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'&#39;Pillinger Point&#39; Overlooking Endeavour Crater on Mars\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/480\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>\\'Pillinger Point\\' Overlooking Endeavour Crater on Mars:</b><span> This May 14, 2014, scene from the Pancam on NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity catches \"Pillinger Point,\" on the western rim of Endeavour Crater, in the foreground and the crater\\'s eastern rim on the horizon.

Because hammering creates friction and releases heat, the mole is first allowed to cool down for a about three days. Then it will be heated up by about 18 degrees Fahrenheit over 24 hours. Temperature sensors within the mole measure how rapidly this happens, which tells scientists the conductivity of the soil.</p>\\n\\n<p>Between the careful burrowing action, the pauses and the time required for the science team to send commands to the instrument, more than a month will go by before the mole reaches its maximum depth.

       "  'date': 'February 11, 2019',\n",
       "  'body': '<p>NASA&rsquo;s 4-year-old atmosphere-sniffing Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission is embarking on a new campaign today to tighten its orbit around Mars. The operation will reduce the highest point of the MAVEN spacecraft&rsquo;s elliptical orbit from 3,850 to 2,800 miles (6,200 to 4,500 kilometers) above the surface and prepare it to take on additional responsibility as a data-relay satellite for NASA&rsquo;s Mars 2020 rover, which launches next year.</p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;The MAVEN spacecraft has done a phenomenal job teaching us how Mars lost its atmosphere and providing other important scientific insights on the evolution of the Martian climate,&rdquo; said Jim Watzin, director of NASA\\'s Mars Exploration Program. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re recruiting it to help NASA communicate with our forthcoming Mars rover and its successors.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>While MAVEN&rsquo;s new orbit will not be drastically shorter than its present orbit, even this small change will significantly improve its communications capabilities. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like using your cell phone,&rdquo; said <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/bruce-jakosky\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce Jakosky</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/maven/overview/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">MAVEN</a> principal investigator from the University of Colorado, Boulder. &ldquo;The closer you are to a cell tower, the stronger your signal.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>A strong telecommunications antenna signal is not the only benefit of a tighter orbit. Coming in nearly 1,000 miles (about 1,500 kilometers) closer also will allow the MAVEN orbiter to circle Mars more frequently &mdash; 6.8 orbits per Earth day versus 5.3 previously &mdash; and thus communicate with the Mars rovers more frequently. While not conducting relay communications, MAVEN will continue to study the structure and composition of the upper atmosphere of Mars. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning a vigorous science mission far into the future,&rdquo; Jakosky said.  </p>\\n\\n<p>The MAVEN mission was designed to last two years in space, but the spacecraft is still operating normally. With the mission managing its fuel to last through 2030, NASA plans to use MAVEN\\'s relay capability as long as possible. The MAVEN orbiter carries an ultra high-frequency radio transceiver &mdash; similar to transceivers carried on other Mars orbiters &shy;&shy;&mdash; that allows it to relay data between Earth and rovers or landers on Mars. The MAVEN spacecraft already has served occasionally as NASA&rsquo;s communication liaison with the Curiosity rover.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the next few months, MAVEN engineers will use a navigation technique known as aerobraking &mdash; like applying the brakes on a car &mdash; to take advantage of the drag of the Red Planet&rsquo;s upper atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down gradually, orbit by orbit. This is the same drag you would feel if you put your hand out of the window of a moving car.</p>\\n\\n<p>Based on the tracking of the spacecraft by the navigation team at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado, engineers will begin carefully lowering the lowest part of the spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit into the Martian upper atmosphere over the next couple of days by firing its thrusters. The spacecraft will circle Mars at this lower altitude about 360 times over the next 2.5 months, slowing down slightly with each pass through the atmosphere. While it may seem like a time-consuming process, aerobraking is the most efficient way to change the spacecraft&rsquo;s trajectory, said Jakosky: &ldquo;The effect is the same as if we fired our thrusters a little bit on every orbit, but this way, we use very little fuel.&rdquo;</p>\\n\\n<p>Fortunately, the team has ample experience operating the spacecraft at these lower altitudes. On nine previous occasions throughout the mission, MAVEN engineers have dipped the orbiter into the same altitude targets for aerobraking to take measurements of the Martian atmosphere. As a result of these &ldquo;deep dips&rdquo; and other measurements, NASA has learned that solar wind and radiation had <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1976/nasas-maven-reveals-most-of-mars-atmosphere-was-lost-to-space/\" target=\"_blank\">stripped Mars of most of its atmosphere</a>, changing the planet&rsquo;s early climate from warm and wet to the dry environment we see today. MAVEN also discovered two <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8355/nasas-maven-spacecraft-finds-that-stolen-electrons-enable-unusual-aurora-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">new types of auroras</a> on Mars and the presence of charged metal atoms <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1977/nasas-maven-reveals-mars-has-metal-in-its-atmosphere/\">in its upper atmosphere</a> that tell us that a lot of debris is hitting Mars that may affect its climate.</p>\\n\\n<p>MAVEN&rsquo;s principal investigator is based at the University of Colorado&rsquo;s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, Boulder. The university provided two science instruments and leads science operations, as well as education and public outreach, for the mission. NASA&rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the MAVEN project and provided two science instruments for the mission. Lockheed Martin built the spacecraft and is responsible for mission operations. The University of California at Berkeley&rsquo;s Space Sciences Laboratory also provided four science instruments for the mission. NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides navigation and Deep Space Network support, as well as the Electra telecommunications relay hardware and operations.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information on the MAVEN mission, visit:<a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/maven\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.nasa.gov/maven </a>or<a href=\"http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/maven/</a></p>\\n',\n",

While there have been a number of clues so far, none fully explains why the ridge has resisted erosion compared with the bedrock around it. But the rover\\'s investigation did find that the rocks of the ridge formed as sediment settled in an ancient lake, similar to rock layers below the ridge.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'ve had our fair share of surprises,\" said Curiosity science team member Abigail Fraeman of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"We\\'re leaving with a different perspective of the ridge than what we had before.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A NASA orbiter studying the ridge had previously identified a strong signal from hematite, an iron-rich mineral that often forms in water. Curiosity confirmed the presence of hematite, along with other signs of ancient water, like <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8305/tiny-crystal-shapes-get-close-look-from-mars-rover/\">crystals</a>. These signs appeared in patches, leading the team to suspect that over time groundwater affected certain parts of the ridge differently than others. Another discovery was that the hematite signatures Curiosity mapped didn\\'t always match the view from space.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The whole traverse is helping us understand all the factors that influence how our orbiters see Mars,\" Fraeman said. \"Looking up close with a rover allowed us to find a lot more of these hematite signatures. It shows how orbiter and rover science complement one another.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The ridge has also served as the backdrop to a roller-coaster year: Curiosity\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8341/drilling-success-curiosity-is-collecting-mars-rocks/\">drill returned to action</a>, only to be stymied by surprisingly hard rocks. Nevertheless, the team managed to get samples from the three major rock types of the ridge. To get around a memory issue, engineers also <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8371/curiosity-on-the-move-again/\">swapped the rover\\'s computers</a> (the spacecraft was designed with two so that it can continue operations if one experiences a glitch). While the issue is still being diagnosed, operations have continued with little impact on the mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>The rover\\'s new home, Glen Torridon, is in a trough between Vera Rubin Ridge and the rest of the mountain. This region had been called the clay-bearing unit because orbiter data show that the rocks there contain phyllosilicates &mdash; clay minerals that form in water and that could tell scientists more about the ancient lakes that were present in Gale Crater off and on throughout its early history.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"In addition to indicating a previously wet environment, clay minerals are known to trap and preserve organic molecules,\" said Curiosity Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of JPL. \"That makes this area especially promising, and the team is already surveying the area for its next drill site.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity has found both clay minerals and organic molecules in many of the rocks it has drilled since landing in 2012. Organic molecules are the chemical building blocks of life. If both water and organic molecules were present when the rocks formed, the clay-bearing unit may be another example of a habitable environment on ancient Mars &mdash; a place capable of supporting life, if it ever existed.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about NASA\\'s Curiosity Mars rover mission, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl\">https://mars.nasa.gov/msl</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b> \\u200b</p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

WALL-E sent back <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8394/nasa-hears-marco-cubesats-loud-and-clear-from-mars/?site=insight\">stunning images</a> of Mars as well, while EVE performed some simple radio science.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of this was achieved with experimental technology that cost a fraction of what most space missions do: $18.5 million provided by NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built the CubeSats.</p>\\n\\n<p>WALL-E was last heard from on Dec. 29; EVE, on Jan. 4. Based on trajectory calculations, WALL-E is currently more than 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) past Mars; EVE is farther, almost 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) past Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission team has several theories for why they haven\\'t been able to contact the pair. WALL-E has a leaky thruster. Attitude-control issues could be causing them to wobble and lose the ability to send and receive commands. The brightness sensors that allow the CubeSats to stay pointed at the Sun and recharge their batteries could be another factor. The MarCOs are in orbit around the Sun and will only get farther away as February wears on. The farther they are, the more precisely they need to point their antennas to communicate with Earth.</p>\\n\\n<p>The MarCOs won\\'t start moving toward the Sun again until this summer. The team will reattempt to contact the CubeSats at that time, though it\\'s anyone\\'s guess whether their batteries and other parts will last that long.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even if they\\'re never revived, the team considers MarCO a spectacular success.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us,\" said Andy Klesh, the mission\\'s chief engineer at JPL. \"We\\'ve put a stake in the ground. Future CubeSats might go even farther.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>A number of the critical spare parts for each MarCO will be used in other CubeSat missions. That includes their experimental radios, antennas and propulsion systems. Several of these systems were provided by commercial vendors, making it easier for other CubeSats to use them as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>More small spacecraft are on the way. NASA is set to launch a variety of new CubeSats in coming years.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"There\\'s big potential in these small packages,\" said John Baker, the MarCO program manager at JPL. \"CubeSats &mdash; part of a larger group of spacecraft called SmallSats &mdash; are a new platform for space exploration that is affordable to more than just government agencies.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Relations Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p>JoAnna Wendel<br />\\nHeadquarters, Washington<br />\\n202-358-1003<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:Joanna.r.wendel@nasa.gov\">Joanna.r.wendel@nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

       "  'date': 'February  4, 2019',\n",
       "  'body': '<p>For the past several weeks, NASA\\'s InSight lander has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nasainsight\" target=\"_blank\">making adjustments</a> to the seismometer it set on the Martian surface <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8402/nasas-insight-places-first-instrument-on-mars/?site=insight\">on Dec. 19</a>. Now it\\'s reached another milestone by placing a domed shield over the seismometer to help the instrument collect accurate data. The seismometer will give scientists their first look at the deep interior of the Red Planet, helping them understand how it and other rocky planets are formed.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Wind and Thermal Shield helps protect the supersensitive instrument from being shaken by passing winds, which can add \"noise\" to its data. The dome\\'s aerodynamic shape causes the wind to press it toward the planet\\'s surface, ensuring it won\\'t flip over. A skirt made of chain mail and <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6708\" target=\"_blank\">thermal blankets</a> rings the bottom, allowing it to settle easily over any rocks, though <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8401/insight-engineers-have-made-a-martian-rock-garden/?site=insight\">there are few at InSight\\'s location</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>An even bigger concern for InSight\\'s seismometer &mdash; called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>) &mdash; is temperature change, which can expand and contract metal springs and other parts inside the seismometer. Where InSight landed, temperatures fluctuate by about 170 degrees Fahrenheit (94 degrees Celsius) over the course of a Martian day, or sol.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Temperature is one of our biggest bugaboos,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the InSight mission and built the Wind and Thermal Shield. \"Think of the shield as putting a cozy over your food on a table. It keeps SEIS from warming up too much during the day or cooling off too much at night. In general, we want to keep the temperature as steady as possible.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>On Earth, seismometers are often buried about four feet (1.2 meters) underground in vaults, which helps keep the temperature stable. InSight can\\'t build a vault on Mars, so the mission relies on several measures to protect its seismometer. The shield is the first line of defense.</p>\\n\\n<p>A second line of defense is SEIS itself, which is specially engineered to correct for wild temperature swings on the Martian surface. The seismometer was built so that as some parts expand and contract, others do so in the opposite direction to partially cancel those effects. Additionally, the instrument is <a href=\"https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/public-2/seis-instrument/evacuated-container\" target=\"_blank\">vacuum-sealed in a titanium sphere</a> that insulates its sensitive insides and reduces the influence of temperature.</p>\\n\\n<p>But even that isn\\'t quite enough. The sphere is enclosed within yet another <a href=\"https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/public-2/seis-instrument/rweb\" target=\"_blank\">insulating container</a> &mdash; a copper-colored hexagonal box visible during SEIS\\'s deployment. The walls of this box are honeycombed with cells that trap air and keep it from moving. Mars provides an excellent gas for this insulation: Its thin atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, which at low pressure is especially slow to conduct heat.</p>\\n\\n<p>With these three insulating barriers, SEIS is well-protected from thermal \"noise\" seeping into the data and masking the seismic waves that InSight\\'s team wants to study. Finally, most additional interference from the Martian environment can be detected by InSight\\'s weather sensors, then filtered out by mission scientists.</p>\\n\\n<p>With the seismometer on the ground and covered, InSight\\'s team is readying for its next step: deploying the heat flow probe, called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>), onto the Martian surface. That\\'s expected to happen next week.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

       "  'date': 'January 31, 2019',\n",
       "  'body': '<p>Apollo 17 astronauts drove a moon buggy across the lunar surface in 1972, measuring gravity with a special instrument. There are no astronauts on Mars, but a group of clever researchers realized they have just the tools for similar experiments with the Martian buggy they\\'re operating.</p>\\n\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/science/researchpapers/\">a new paper in Science</a>, the researchers detail how they repurposed sensors used to drive the Curiosity rover and turned them into gravimeters, which measure changes in gravitational pull. That enabled them to measure the subtle tug from rock layers on lower Mount Sharp, which rises <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/3818/mount-sharp-on-mars-compared-to-three-big-mountains-on-earth/\">3 miles (5 kilometers)</a> from the base of Gale Crater and which Curiosity has been climbing since 2014. The results? It turns out the density of those rock layers is much lower than expected.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Just like a smartphone, Curiosity carries accelerometers and gyroscopes. Moving your smartphone allows these sensors to determine its location and which way it\\'s facing. Curiosity\\'s sensors do the same thing but with far more precision, playing a crucial role in navigating the Martian surface on each drive. Knowing the rover\\'s orientation also lets engineers accurately point its instruments and multidirectional, high-gain antenna.</p>\\n\\n<p>By happy coincidence, the rover\\'s accelerometers can be used like Apollo 17\\'s gravimeter. The accelerometers detect the gravity of the planet whenever the rover stands still. Using engineering data from the first five years of the mission, the paper\\'s authors measured the gravitational tug of Mars on the rover. As Curiosity ascends Mount Sharp, the mountain adds additional gravity &mdash; but not as much as scientists expected.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous,\" said lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. \"We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\\'t buried by as much material as we thought.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Science from a Mars Buggy</b></p>\\n\\n<p>The Apollo 17 astronauts drove their buggy across the Moon\\'s Taurus-Littrow Valley, periodically stopping to capture 25 measurements. Lewis has studied Martian gravity fields using data collected by NASA\\'s orbiters and was familiar with Apollo 17\\'s gravimeter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Science paper uses over 700 measurements from Curiosity\\'s accelerometers, taken between October 2012 and June 2017. These data were calibrated to filter out \"noise,\" such as the effects of temperature and the tilt of the rover during its climb. The calculations were then compared to models of Mars\\' gravity fields to ensure accuracy.</p>\\n\\n<p>The results were also compared to mineral-density estimates from Curiosity\\'s Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument, which characterizes the crystalline minerals in rock samples by using an X-ray beam. That data helped inform how porous the rocks are.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mountain of Mystery</b></p>\\n\\n<p>There are many mountains within craters or canyons on Mars, but few approach the scale of Mount Sharp. Scientists still aren\\'t sure how the mountain grew inside of Gale Crater. One idea is that the crater was once filled with sediment. How much of it was filled remains a source of debate, but the thinking is that many millions of years of wind and erosion eventually excavated the mountain.</p>\\n\\n<p>If the crater had been filled to the brim, all that material should have pressed down, or compacted, the many layers of fine-grained sediment beneath it. But the new paper suggests Mount Sharp\\'s lower layers have been compacted by only a half-mile to a mile (1 to 2 kilometers) &mdash; much less than if the crater had been completely filled.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle,\" said study co-author Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\\'s project scientist at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. JPL manages the Mars Science Laboratory mission that Curiosity is a part of. \"I\\'m thrilled that creative scientists and engineers are still finding innovative ways to make new scientific discoveries with the rover,\" he added.</p>\\n\\n<p>Lewis said that Mars holds plenty of mystery beyond Mount Sharp. Its landscape is like Earth\\'s, but sculpted more by wind and blowing sand than by water. They\\'re planetary siblings, at once familiar and starkly different.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"To me, Mars is the uncanny valley of Earth,\" Lewis said. \"It\\'s similar but was shaped by different processes. It feels so unnatural to our terrestrial experience.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about Curiosity, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>For more about NASA\\'s Mars program, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/\">https://mars.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Relations Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

The new commands, which will be beamed to the rover during the next several weeks, address low-likelihood events that could have occurred aboard Opportunity, preventing it from transmitting.</p>\\n\\n<p>The rover\\'s last communication with Earth was received June 10, 2018, as a <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8348/opportunity-hunkers-down-during-dust-storm/\">planet-wide dust storm</a> blanketed the solar-powered rover\\'s location on Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We have and will continue to use multiple techniques in our attempts to contact the rover,\" said John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at JPL. \"These new command strategies are in addition to the \\'sweep and beep\\' commands we have been transmitting up to the rover since September.\" With \"sweep and beep,\" instead of just listening for Opportunity, the project sends commands to the rover to respond back with a beep.</p>\\n\\n<p>The new transmission strategies are expected to go on for several weeks. They address three possible scenarios: that the rover\\'s primary X-band radio &mdash; which Opportunity uses to communicate with Earth &mdash; has failed; that both its primary and secondary X-band radios have failed; or that the rover\\'s internal clock, which provides a timeframe for its computer brain, is offset. A series of unlikely events would need to have transpired for any one of these faults to occur. The potential remedies being beamed up to address these unlikely events include a command for the rover to switch to its backup X-band radio and commands directed to reset the clock and respond via UHF.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Over the past seven months we have attempted to contact Opportunity over 600 times,\" said Callas. \"While we have not heard back from the rover and the probability that we ever will is decreasing each day, we plan to continue to pursue every logical solution that could put us back in touch.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Time is of the essence for the Opportunity team. The \"dust-clearing season\" &mdash; the time of year on Mars when increased winds could clear the rover\\'s solar panels of dust that might be preventing it from charging its batteries &mdash; is drawing to a close. Meanwhile, Mars is heading into southern winter, which brings with it extremely low temperatures that are likely to cause irreparable harm to an unpowered rover\\'s batteries, internal wiring and/or computer systems.</p>\\n\\n<p>If either these additional transmission strategies or \"sweep and beep\" generates a response from the rover, engineers could attempt a recovery. If Opportunity does not respond, the project team would again consult with the Mars Program Office at JPL and NASA Headquarters to determine the path forward.</p>\\n\\n<p>For more information about Opportunity and the Mars Exploration Rover program, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/index.html\">https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/home/index.html</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>DC Agle<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-9011<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:agle@jpl.nasa.gov\">agle@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

The golf-cart-sized rover was designed to travel 1,100 yards (1,006 meters) and operate on the Red Planet for 90 Martian days (sols). It has traveled over 28 miles (45 kilometers) and logged its 5,000th Martian day (or sol) back in February of 2018.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Fifteen years on the surface of Mars is testament not only to a magnificent machine of exploration but the dedicated and talented team behind it that has allowed us to expand our discovery space of the Red Planet,\" said John Callas, project manager for Opportunity at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"However, this anniversary cannot help but be a little bittersweet as at present we don&rsquo;t know the rover&rsquo;s status. We are doing everything in our power to communicate with Opportunity, but as time goes on, the probability of a successful contact with the rover continues to diminish.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Opportunity\\'s last communication with Earth was received June 10, 2018, as a planet-wide dust storm <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8348/opportunity-hunkers-down-during-dust-storm/\">blanketed the solar-powered rover\\'s location</a> on the western rim of Perseverance Valley, eventually blocking out so much sunlight that the rover could no longer charge its batteries. Although the storm eventually abated and <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8370/opportunity-emerges-in-a-dusty-picture/\">the skies over Perseverance cleared</a>, the rover has not communicated with Earth since then. However, Opportunity\\'s mission continues, in a phase where mission engineers at JPL are sending commands to as well as listening for signals from the rover. If engineers hear from the rover, they could attempt a recovery.</p>\\n\\n<p>Opportunity and its twin rover, Spirit, launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2003.

Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8401/insight-engineers-have-made-a-martian-rock-garden/\">the test bed at JPL</a> deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach ---- 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away).</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,\" said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. \"The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion &mdash; also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet\\'s interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,\" said Philippe Lognonn&eacute;, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) and Paris Diderot University. \"We\\'re thrilled that we\\'re now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars\\' surface and from its deep interior.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position.</p>\\n\\n<p>But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES) and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer\\'s long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors.</p>\\n\\n<p>Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP<sup>3</sup> will be on the east side of the lander\\'s work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer.</p>\\n\\n<p>For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data (however noisy) back from the Martian surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight\\'s seismometer on the ground,\" Banerdt added. \"I have a bottle ready for the occasion.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

Thankfully, <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22212/mosaic-of-insights-workspace/?site=insight\">a composite image of the workspace</a> released last week revealed the area was smooth and largely rock-free, making the job easier than expected.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s great for the science we want to do,\" said JPL\\'s Marleen Sundgaard, who is guiding the test-bed work. \"It\\'s the flat parking lot the landing team promised us.

The spacecraft used a camera on its robotic arm to take its first selfie &mdash; a mosaic made up of 11 images. This is the same imaging process used by NASA\\'s Curiosity rover mission, in which many overlapping pictures are taken and later stitched together. Visible in the selfie are the lander\\'s solar panel and its entire deck, including its science instruments.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mission team members have also received their first complete look at InSight\\'s \"workspace\" &mdash; the approximately 14-by-7-foot (4-by-2-meter) crescent of terrain directly in front of the spacecraft. This image is also a mosaic composed of 52 individual photos.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the coming weeks, scientists and engineers will go through the painstaking process of deciding where in this workspace the spacecraft\\'s instruments should be placed. They will then command InSight\\'s robotic arm to carefully set the seismometer (called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, or <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>) and heat-flow probe (known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, or <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>) in the chosen locations. Both work best on level ground, and engineers want to avoid setting them on rocks larger than about a half-inch (1.3 cm).</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it\\'ll be extremely safe for our instruments,\" said InSight\\'s Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\\'t on Mars, but we\\'re glad to see that.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight\\'s landing team deliberately chose a landing region in Elysium Planitia that is relatively free of rocks. Even so, the landing spot turned out even better than they hoped. The spacecraft sits in what appears to be a nearly rock-free \"hollow\" &mdash; a depression created by a meteor impact that later filled with sand.

A media teleconference about these sounds will be held today at 12:30 p.m. EST (9:30 a.m. PST).</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight sensors captured a haunting low rumble caused by vibrations from the wind, estimated to be blowing between 10 to 15 mph (5 to 7 meters a second) on Dec. 1, from northwest to southeast. The winds were consistent with the direction of dust devil streaks in the landing area, which were observed from orbit.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Capturing this audio was an unplanned treat,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. \"But one of the things our mission is dedicated to is measuring motion on Mars, and naturally that includes motion caused by sound waves.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Teleconference audio and accompanying visuals will stream live on NASA\\'s <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/live\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. A follow-along page is available at:</p>\\n\\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/insightmarswind\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nasa.gov/insightmarswind</a></b></p>\\n\\n<p>Two very sensitive sensors on the spacecraft detected these wind vibrations: an air pressure sensor inside the lander and a seismometer sitting on the lander\\'s deck, awaiting deployment by InSight\\'s robotic arm. The two instruments recorded the wind noise in different ways. The air pressure sensor, part of the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Subsystem (APSS), which will collect meteorological data, recorded these air vibrations directly. The seismometer recorded lander vibrations caused by the wind moving over the spacecraft\\'s solar panels, which are each 7 feet (2.2 meters) in diameter and stick out from the sides of the lander like a giant pair of ears.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is the only phase of the mission during which the seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/seis/\">SEIS</a>), will be capable of detecting vibrations generated directly by the lander. In a few weeks, it will be placed on the Martian surface by InSight\\'s robotic arm, then covered by a domed shield to protect it from wind and temperature changes. It still will detect the lander\\'s movement, though channeled through the Martian surface. For now, it\\'s recording vibrational data that scientists later will be able to use to cancel out noise from the lander when SEIS is on the surface, allowing them to detect better actual marsquakes.</p>\\n\\n<p>When earthquakes occur on Earth, their vibrations, which bounce around inside our planet, make it \"ring\" similar to how a bell creates sound. InSight will see if tremors, or marsquakes, have a similar effect on Mars. SEIS will detect these vibrations that will tell us about the Red Planet\\'s deep interior. Scientists hope this will lead to new information on the formation of the planets in our solar system, perhaps even of our own planet.</p>\\n\\n<p>SEIS, provided by France\\'s Centre National d\\'&Eacute;tudes Spatiales (CNES), includes two sets of seismometers. Those contributed by the French will be used once SEIS is deployed from the deck of the lander. But SEIS also includes short period (SP) silicon sensors developed by Imperial College London with electronics from Oxford University in the United Kingdom. These sensors can work while on the deck of the lander and are capable of detecting vibrations up to frequencies of nearly 50 hertz, at the lower range of human hearing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The InSight lander acts like a giant ear,\" said Tom Pike, InSight science team member and sensor designer at Imperial College London. \"The solar panels on the lander\\'s sides respond to pressure fluctuations of the wind. It\\'s like InSight is cupping its ears and hearing the Mars wind beating on it. When we looked at the direction of the lander vibrations coming from the solar panels, it matches the expected wind direction at our landing site.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Pike compared the effect to a flag in the wind. As a flag breaks up the wind, it creates oscillations in air pressure that the human ear perceives as flapping. Separately, APSS records changes in pressure directly from the thin Martian air.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"That\\'s literally what sound is &mdash; changes in air pressure,\" said Don Banfield InSight\\'s science lead for APSS from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \"You hear that whenever you speak to someone across the room.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Unlike the vibrations recorded by the short period sensors, audio from APSS is about 10 hertz, below the range of human hearing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The raw audio sample from the seismometer was released unaltered; a second version was raised two octaves to be more perceptible to the human ear &mdash; especially when heard through laptop or mobile speakers. The second audio sample from APSS was sped up by a factor of 100, which shifted it up in frequency.</p>\\n\\n<p>An even clearer sound from Mars is yet to come. In just a couple years, NASA\\'s Mars 2020 rover is scheduled to land with two microphones on board. The first, <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/#EDL-Cameras-Microphone\">provided by JPL</a>, is included specifically to record, for the first time, the sound of a Mars landing. The second is part of the <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/supercam/\">SuperCam</a> and will be able to detect the sound of the instrument\\'s laser as it zaps different materials. This will help identify these materials based on the change in sound frequency.</p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

However, imaging was momentarily interrupted, resuming the following day. During the first few weeks in its new home, InSight has been instructed to be extra careful, so anything unexpected will trigger what\\'s called a fault.

But we know that everything is a little different for the lander on Mars, so faults are not unusual,\" Hoffman said. \"They can delay operations, but we\\'re not in a rush. We want to be sure that each operation that we perform on Mars is safe, so we set our safety monitors to be fairly sensitive initially.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Spacecraft engineers had already factored extra time into their estimates for instrument deployment to account for likely delays caused by faults.

Rocks and slopes could affect InSight\\'s ability to place its heat-flow probe &mdash; also known as \"the mole,\" or HP<sup>3</sup> &mdash; and ultra-sensitive seismometer, known as SEIS, on the surface of Mars.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Touching down on an overly steep slope in the wrong direction could also have jeopardized the spacecraft\\'s ability to get adequate power output from its two solar arrays, while landing beside a large rock could have prevented InSight from being able to open one of those arrays. In fact, both arrays fully deployed shortly after landing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\'image_module right\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'Unlatching InSight&#39;s Arm\\' src=\\'/internal_resources/451\\'>\\n<figcaption>\\nAs visible in this two-frame set of images, NASA&rsquo;s InSight spacecraft unlatched its robotic arm on Nov. 27, 2018, the day after it landed on Mars.

       "  'date': 'November 27, 2018',\n",
       "  'body': '<p>NASA\\'s MarCO mission was built to see whether two experimental, briefcase-sized spacecraft could survive the trip to deep space, and the two CubeSats proved more than able. After cruising along behind NASA\\'s InSight for seven months, they successfully relayed data back down to Earth from the lander during its descent to the Martian surface on Monday, Nov. 26.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nicknamed \"EVE\" and \"WALL-E\" after the stars of the 2008 Pixar film, MarCO-A and MarCO-B used experimental radios and antennas, providing an alternate way for engineers to monitor the landing. The CubeSats provided information to InSight\\'s landing team in just 8 minutes &mdash; the time it took for radio signals to travel from Mars to Earth. That was much faster than waiting on NASA\\'s Mars orbiters, which weren\\'t positioned to be able to observe the entire event and send data back to Earth immediately.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"WALL-E and EVE performed just as we expected them to,\" said MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which built the CubeSats. \"They were an excellent test of how CubeSats can serve as \\'tag-alongs\\' on future missions, giving engineers up-to-the-minute feedback during a landing.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Landing on Mars is exceptionally difficult: Before InSight, only about 40 percent of all attempts by various nations had succeeded. Even if a spacecraft doesn\\'t survive landing, having a \"black box\" &mdash; or a pair of them, as with MarCO &mdash; to record the event can help engineers design better landing technology.</p>\\n\\n<p>Neither of the MarCO CubeSats carry science instruments, but that didn\\'t stop the team from testing whether future CubeSats could perform useful science at Mars. As MarCO-A flew by, it conducted some impromptu radio science, transmitting signals through the edge of Mars\\' atmosphere. Interference from the Martian atmosphere changes the signal when received on Earth, allowing scientists to determine how much atmosphere is present and, to some degree, what it\\'s made of.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"CubeSats have incredible potential to carry cameras and science instruments out to deep space,\" said John Baker, JPL\\'s program manager for small spacecraft. \"They\\'ll never replace the more capable spacecraft NASA is best known for developing. But they\\'re low-cost ride-alongs that can allow us to explore in new ways.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>As a bonus, some consumer-grade cameras aboard MarCO provided \"drive-by\" images as the CubeSats sailed past Mars. MarCO-B was programmed to turn so that it could image the planet in a sequence of shots as it approached Mars (before launch, MarCO-A\\'s cameras were found to be either non-functioning or too blurry to use).</p>\\n\\n<p>After the landing, MarCO-B turned backward to take a farewell shot of the Red Planet. It also attempted to snap some photos of Mars\\' moons, Phobos and Deimos.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"WALL-E sent some great postcards from Mars!\" said Cody Colley of JPL, MarCO\\'s mission manager, who led the work to program each CubeSat to take images. \"It\\'s been exciting to see the view from almost 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) above the surface.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>With the mission\\'s objectives reached, the MarCO team will spend the next couple of weeks collecting additional data on each CubeSat. Of interest will be how much fuel is left in each CubeSat and detailed analyses of how their relay capability performed.</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s also sure to be more celebrating among the team.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"MarCO is mostly made up of early-career engineers and, for many, MarCO is their first experience out of college on a NASA mission,\" said Joel Krajewski of JPL, MarCO\\'s project manager. \"We are proud of their accomplishment. It\\'s given them valuable experience on every facet of building, testing and operating a spacecraft in deep space.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>For more about MarCO, visit <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/insight/landing/appendix/mars-cube-one/\">this</a> link.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Media Relations Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\n<a href=\"mailto:andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov\">andrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n',\n",

Mars has weaker sunlight than Earth because it\\'s much farther away from the Sun. But the lander doesn\\'t need much to operate: The panels provide 600 to 700 watts on a clear day, enough to power a household blender and plenty to keep its instruments conducting science on the Red Planet. Even when dust covers the panels &mdash; what is likely to be a common occurrence on Mars &mdash; they should be able to provide at least 200 to 300 watts.</p>\\n\\n<p>The panels are modeled on those used with NASA\\'s <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/past/phoenix/\">Phoenix Mars Lander</a>, though InSight&rsquo;s are slightly larger in order to provide more power output and to increase their structural strength. These changes were necessary to support operations for one full Mars year (two Earth years).</p>\\n\\n<p>In the coming days, the mission team will unstow InSight\\'s robotic arm and use the attached camera to snap photos of the ground so that engineers can decide where to place the spacecraft\\'s scientific instruments.

In addition, the fourth paragraph has been updated with information about the trajectory correction maneuver conducted by the mission team on the afternoon of Nov. 25.</i></p>\\n\\n<p>In mere hours, NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft will complete its seven-month journey to Mars. It will have cruised 301,223,981 miles (484,773,006 kilometers), entering the Martian atmosphere at a top speed of 12,300 mph (19,800 kilometers per hour).</p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the mission, are preparing for the spacecraft to enter the Martian atmosphere, descend with a parachute and retrorockets, and touch down tomorrow at around noon PST (3 p.m. EST). InSight &mdash; which stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport &mdash; will be the first mission to study the deep interior of Mars.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We\\'ve studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,\" said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate. \"Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbor as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Before InSight enters the Martian atmosphere, there are a few final preparations to make. At 1:47 p.m. PST (4:47 p.m. EST) engineers successfully conducted a last trajectory correction maneuver to steer the spacecraft within a few kilometers of its targeted entry point over Mars. Engineers still need to conduct a last trajectory correction maneuver to steer the spacecraft toward its entry point over Mars. About two hours before hitting the atmosphere, the entry, descent and landing (EDL) team might also upload some final tweaks to the algorithm that guides the spacecraft safely to the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>These will be the last commands issued to InSight before it robotically guides itself the rest of the way. The EDL team worked for months beforehand to pre-program every stage of InSight\\'s landing, making adjustments based on weather reports from NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"While most of the country was enjoying Thanksgiving with their family and friends, the InSight team was busy making the final preparations for Monday\\'s landing,\" said Tom Hoffman of JPL, InSight\\'s project manager. \"Landing on Mars is difficult and takes a lot of personal sacrifices, such as missing the traditional Thanksgiving, but making InSight successful is well worth the extraordinary effort.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers will be huddled with scientists at JPL on Nov. 26, watching with nervous anticipation for <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8385/how-nasa-will-know-when-insight-touches-down/\">signals</a> that InSight successfully touched down.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s taken more than a decade to bring InSight from a concept to a spacecraft approaching Mars &mdash; and even longer since I was first inspired to try to undertake this kind of mission,\" said Bruce Banerdt of JPL, InSight\\'s principal investigator. \"But even after landing, we\\'ll need to be patient for the science to begin.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>It will take two to three months for InSight\\'s robotic arm to set the mission\\'s instruments on the surface. During that time, engineers will monitor the environment and photograph the terrain in front of the lander.</p>\\n\\n<p>Back at JPL, the surface operations team will practice setting down the instruments. They\\'ll use a working replica of InSight in an indoor <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/21534/360-video-tour-a-mars-robot-test-lab/?site=insight\">\"Mars sandbox,\"</a> which will be sculpted to match the mission\\'s actual landing site on Mars. The team will check to make sure the instruments can be deployed safely, even if there are rocks nearby or InSight lands at an angle.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once the final position of each instrument is decided, it will take several weeks to carefully lift each one and calibrate their measurements.

       "  'body': '<p>Mars and Earth are like two siblings who have grown apart.</p>\\n\\n<p>There was a time when their resemblance was uncanny: Both were warm, wet and shrouded in thick atmospheres. But 3 or 4 billion years ago, these two worlds took different paths.</p>\\n\\n<p>We may soon know why they went their separate ways. NASA\\'s InSight spacecraft will arrive at the Red Planet on Monday, Nov. 26, and will allow scientists to compare Earth to its rusty sibling like never before.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight (short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) won\\'t be looking for life on Mars. But studying its insides &mdash; what it\\'s made of, how that material is layered and how much heat seeps out of it &mdash; could help scientists better understand how a planet\\'s starting materials make it more or less likely to support life.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Earth and Mars were molded out of very similar stuff,\" said Bruce Banerdt, InSight\\'s principal investigator at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which leads the mission. \"Why did the finished planets turn out so differently? Our measurements will help us turn back the clock and understand what produced a verdant Earth but a desolate Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Serving Life on a Plate</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Long ago, Mars stopped changing, while Earth continued to evolve.</p>\\n\\n<p>Earth developed a kind of geological \"conveyer belt\" that Mars never had: tectonic plates. When they converge, they can push the crust into the planet. When they move apart, they enable new crust to emerge.</p>\\n\\n<p>This churning of material brings more than just rock to the surface. Some of life\\'s most vital ingredients are so-called volatiles, which include water, carbon dioxide and methane. Because they change into gas easily (that\\'s what makes them volatile), they can be released by tectonic action.</p>\\n\\n<p>The fact that Mars doesn\\'t have tectonic plates suggests its crust was never recycled back into the planet\\'s interior. Could the appearance of life depend on whether tectonic plates are present to churn up volatiles?</p>\\n\\n<p>\"One of our key questions regarding habitability is, what are the key conditions planets need for life to form?\" said Sue Smrekar, InSight\\'s deputy principal investigator at JPL. \"Understanding a planet\\'s initial building blocks set the stage for how processes that affect the environment evolve over time.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight could help answer these questions by using <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/\">a seismometer</a>, called Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), to watch how quakes &mdash; which can be caused by processes other than just tectonic action &mdash; travel through Mars. Understanding how the planet is layered will help scientists work backward, piecing together how dust, metals and ices in the early solar system combined to form the Red Planet.  </p>\\n\\n<p><b>Red Hot Mars</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Every rocky planet traps a reserve of heat in its interior. Some is trapped when a planet forms; the rest comes from radioactive materials decaying over time. That heat then gradually wends its way to the surface, melting rock layers, fracturing crust and creating volcanoes that belch out volatile gases.</p>\\n\\n<p>Heat is important for several reasons. It could have created hot springs early in Martian history, warming the subsurface from below. It could have spewed steam out of volcanoes that later condensed into streams and oceans.</p>\\n\\n<p>By measuring Mars\\' internal temperature with <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/hp3/\">a probe</a>, called Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/hp3/\">HP<sup>3</sup></a>), InSight could help explain how heat shaped the planet\\'s surface, making it more or less habitable over time.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>A Naked Planet</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Heat keeps a planet\\'s core molten and flowing. Metallic elements in that core generate electric currents as they move, producing a magnetic field. That magnetic field is like invisible armor, shielding a planet &mdash; and any life-forms that may be on it &mdash; against radiation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars once had a strong magnetic field; many of the oldest parts of the planet\\'s crust are highly magnetized. But billions of years ago, most of this field disappeared, leaving Mars unprotected.</p>\\n\\n<p>To better understand why Mars\\' magnetic field vanished, InSight\\'s scientists want to learn more about the planet\\'s core. Whether the core is liquid, solid or a combination of both affects how the planet wobbles on its axis, just like the liquid yolk inside a spinning, raw egg will result in a different wobble than the denser, solid yolk of a cooked egg.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/rise/\">A radio experiment</a>, called Rotation and Structure Experiment (RISE), will help InSight\\'s scientists measure Mars\\' wobble. Combined with data about the planet\\'s layers and heat, the findings will make it possible to piece together how Mars lost its magnetic field.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mars\\' wobble, tectonic activity and heat flow &mdash; all three can help explain what set these planetary siblings on different roads, only one of which provides much better conditions for life today.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Mars is a laboratory for how all these processes happen early in a planet\\'s formation,\" Smrekar said. \"InSight will help constrain our models of how planets are made and change over time.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

Western Isidis presents some of the oldest and most scientifically interesting landscapes Mars has to offer. Mission scientists believe the 28-mile-wide (45-kilometer-wide) crater, once home to an ancient river delta, could have collected and preserved ancient organic molecules and other potential signs of microbial life from the water and sediments that flowed into the crater billions of years ago.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jezero Crater\\'s ancient lake-delta system offers many promising sampling targets of at least five kinds of rock, including clays and carbonates that have high potential to preserve signatures of past life. In addition, the material carried into the delta from a large watershed may contain a wide variety of minerals from inside and outside the crater.</p>\\n\\n<p>The geologic diversity that makes Jezero so appealing to Mars 2020 scientists also makes it a challenge for the team\\'s entry, descent and landing (EDL) engineers. Along with the massive nearby river delta and small crater impacts, the site contains numerous boulders and rocks to the east, cliffs to the west and depressions filled with aeolian bedforms (wind-derived ripples in sand that could trap a rover) in several locations.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The Mars community has long coveted the scientific value of sites such as Jezero Crater, and a previous mission contemplated going there, but the challenges with safely landing were considered prohibitive,\" said Ken Farley, project scientist for Mars 2020 at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"But what was once out of reach is now conceivable, thanks to the 2020 engineering team and advances in Mars entry, descent and landing technologies.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>When the landing site search began, mission engineers already had refined the landing system such that they were able to reduce the Mars 2020 landing zone to an area 50 percent smaller than that for the landing of NASA\\'s <a href=\"http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">Curiosity</a> rover at Gale Crater in 2012. This allowed the science community to consider more challenging landing sites. The sites of greatest scientific interest led NASA to add a new capability called <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/technology/entry-descent-landing/\">Terrain Relative Navigation</a> (TRN). TRN will enable the \"sky crane\" descent stage, the rocket-powered system that carries the rover down to the surface, to avoid hazardous areas.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\'column-width image_module\\' style=\\'\\'>\\n<figure class=\\'inline_figure\\'>\\n<a class=\\'inline_image_enlarge fancybox\\' href=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22141_MOLAmap-web.jpg\\'>\\n<img alt=\\'This Mars map depicts the final four locations under consideration for the landing site of Mars 2020.\\' src=\\'/system/resources/detail_files/22141_MOLAmap-web.jpg\\'>\\n<div class=\\'enlarge_icon\\'></div>\\n</a>\\n<figcaption>\\n<b>2020&rsquo;s Final Four</b>: This Mars map depicts the final four locations under consideration for the landing site of Mars 2020.

The team will continue its work to truly understand the TRN system and the risks involved, and we will review the findings independently to reassure we have maximized our chances for success.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Selecting a landing site this early allows the rover drivers and science operations team to optimize their plans for exploring Jezero Crater once the rover is safely on the ground.

       "  'body': '<p>What\\'s the sound of a touchdown on Mars?</p>\\n\\n<p>If you\\'re at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it sounds like winning the Super Bowl: cheers, laughter and lots of hollering.</p>\\n\\n<p>But in the minutes before that, NASA\\'s InSight team will be monitoring the Mars lander\\'s radio signals using a variety of spacecraft &mdash; and even radio telescopes here on Earth &mdash; to suss out what\\'s happening 91 million miles (146 million km) away.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because these signals are captured by several spacecraft, they\\'re relayed to Earth in different ways and at different times. That means the mission team may know right away when InSight touches down, or they may have to wait up to several hours.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here\\'s how NASA will be listening for the next Mars landing on Nov. 26.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Radio Telescopes</b></p>\\n\\n<p>As the InSight lander descends into Mars\\' atmosphere, it will broadcast simple radio signals called \"tones\" back to Earth. Engineers will be tuning in from two locations: the National Science Foundation\\'s Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy&rsquo;s facility at Effelsberg, Germany. Their results will be relayed to Mission Control at JPL and engineers at Lockheed Martin Space in Denver.</p>\\n\\n<p>These tones don\\'t reveal much information, but radio engineers can interpret them to track key events during InSight\\'s entry, descent and landing (EDL). For example, when InSight deploys its parachute, a shift in velocity changes the frequency of the signal. This is caused by what\\'s called the Doppler effect, which is the same thing that occurs when you hear a siren change in pitch as an ambulance goes by. Looking for signals like these will allow the team to know how InSight\\'s EDL is progressing.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mars Cube One (MarCO)</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Two briefcase-sized spacecraft are flying behind InSight and will attempt to relay its signals to Earth. Belonging to a class of spacecraft called CubeSats, the MarCOs are being tested as a way for future missions to send home data during EDL.</p>\\n\\n<p>The MarCOs are experimental technology. But if they work as they should, the pair will transmit the whole story of EDL as it\\'s unfolding. That might include an image from InSight of the Martian surface right after the lander touches down.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>After it touches down, InSight will essentially yell, \"I made it!\" Seven minutes later, the spacecraft says it again &mdash; but a little louder and clearer.</p>\\n\\n<p>The first time, it will communicate with a tone beacon that the radio telescopes will try to detect. The second time, it will send a \"beep\" from its more powerful X-band antenna, which should now be pointed at Earth. This beep includes slightly more information and is only heard if the spacecraft is in a healthy, functioning state. If NASA\\'s Deep Space Network picks up this beep, it\\'s a good sign that InSight survived landing. Engineers will need to wait until early evening to find out if the lander successfully deployed its solar arrays.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Besides the MarCO CubeSats, NASA\\'s MRO will be soaring over Mars, recording InSight\\'s data during descent.</p>\\n\\n<p>MRO will hold on to the data it records during EDL as it disappears over the Martian horizon. When it comes back around from the other side, it will play back that data for engineers to study. By 3 p.m. PST (6 p.m. EST), they should be able to piece together MRO\\'s recording of the landing.</p>\\n\\n<p>MRO\\'s recording is similar to an airplane\\'s black box, which means that it could also prove important if InSight doesn\\'t successfully touch down.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>2001 Mars Odyssey</b></p>\\n\\n<p>NASA\\'s longest-lived spacecraft at Mars will also relay data after InSight has touched down. Odyssey will relay the entire history of InSight\\'s descent to Mars, as well as a couple images. It will also relay confirmation that InSight\\'s solar arrays, which are vital to the spacecraft\\'s survival, fully deployed. Engineers will have this data just before 5:30 p.m. PST (8:30 p.m. EST).</p>\\n\\n<p>Odyssey will also serve as a data relay for InSight during surface operations, along with MRO, NASA\\'s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission (MAVEN) and the European Space Agency\\'s Trace Gas Orbiter.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>About InSight</b></p>\\n\\n<p>JPL manages InSight for NASA\\'s Science Mission Directorate.

This was Curiosity\\'s longest drive since experiencing a memory anomaly on Sept. 15. The rover switched to a spare computer, called the Side-A computer, on Oct. 3. </p>\\n\\n<p>After more than two weeks of science operations, and now with this latest drive, the mission is back to business. The team plans to drill a new target later this week.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curiosity\\'s engineering team at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory continues to diagnose the anomaly on the Side-B computer.</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n<p><i><b>Original story posted October 3, 2018</b></i><br />\\n<b>Curiosity Rover to Temporarily Switch \\'Brains\\'</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Engineers at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, this week commanded the agency\\'s Curiosity rover to switch to its second computer. The switch will enable engineers to do a detailed diagnosis of a technical issue that has prevented the rover\\'s active computer from storing science and some key engineering data since Sept. 15. </p>\\n\\n<p>Like many NASA spacecraft, Curiosity was designed with two, redundant computers -- in this case, referred to as a Side-A and a Side-B computer -- so that it can continue operations if one experiences a glitch. After reviewing several options, JPL engineers recommended that the rover switch from Side B to Side A, the computer the rover used initially after landing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The rover continues to send limited engineering data stored in short-term memory when it connects to a relay orbiter. It is otherwise healthy and receiving commands. But whatever is preventing Curiosity from storing science data in long-term memory is also preventing the storage of the rover\\'s event records, a journal of all its actions that engineers need in order to make a diagnosis. The computer swap will allow data and event records to be stored on the Side-A computer.</p>\\n\\n<p>Side A experienced hardware and software issues over five years ago on sol 200 of the mission, leaving the rover uncommandable and running down its battery. At that time, the team successfully switched to Side B. Engineers have since diagnosed and quarantined the part of Side A\\'s memory that was affected so that computer is again available to support the mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"At this point, we\\'re confident we\\'ll be getting back to full operations, but it\\'s too early to say how soon,\" said Steven Lee of JPL, Curiosity\\'s deputy project manager. \"We are operating on Side A starting today, but it could take us time to fully understand the root cause of the issue and devise workarounds for the memory on Side B.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"We spent the last week checking out Side A and preparing it for the swap,\" Lee said. \"It\\'s certainly possible to run the mission on the Side-A computer if we really need to. But our plan is to switch back to Side B as soon as we can fix the problem to utilize its larger memory size.\" </p>\\n\\n<p>For more about Curiosity, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/\">https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>For more about NASA\\'s Mars program, visit:<br />\\n<a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/\">https://mars.nasa.gov</a></p>\\n\\n<p><b>News Media Contact</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Andrew Good<br />\\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.<br />\\n818-393-2433<br />\\nandrew.c.good@jpl.nasa.gov</p>\\n',\n",

It is InSight\\'s job to study the deep interior of Mars, taking the planet\\'s vital signs &ndash; its pulse, temperature and reflexes.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Taking those vital signs will help the InSight science team look back to a time when the rocky planets of the solar system formed. The investigations will depend on three instruments:</p>\\n\\n<p>A six-sensor seismometer called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) will record seismic waves traveling through the interior structure of the planet. Studying seismic waves will tell scientists what might be creating the waves. (On Mars, scientists suspect that the culprits may be marsquakes or meteorites striking the surface.)</p>\\n\\n<p>The mission\\'s Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP<sup>3</sup>) will burrow deeper than any other scoop, drill or probe on Mars before to gauge how much heat is flowing out of the planet.

We needed not just a safe place to land, but also a workspace that\\'s penetrable by our 16-foot-long (5-meter) heat-flow probe.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The site also needs to be bright enough and warm enough to power the solar cells while keeping its electronics within temperature limits for an entire Martian year (26 Earth months).</p>\\n\\n<p>So the team focused on a band around the equator, where the lander\\'s solar array would have adequate sunlight to power its systems year-round. Finding an area that would be safe enough for InSight to land and then deploy its solar panels and instruments without obstructions took a little longer.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"The site has to be a low-enough elevation to have sufficient atmosphere above it for a safe landing, because the spacecraft will rely first on atmospheric friction with its heat shield and then on a parachute digging into Mars\\' tenuous atmosphere for a large portion of its deceleration,\" said Hoffman. \"And after the chute has fallen away and the braking rockets have kicked in for final descent, there needs to be a flat expanse to land on &ndash; not too undulating and relatively free of rocks that could tip the tri-legged Mars lander.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Of 22 sites considered, only Elysium Planitia, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris met the basic engineering constraints. To grade the three remaining contenders, reconnaissance images from NASA\\'s Mars orbiters were scoured and weather records searched. Eventually, Isidis Planitia and Valles Marineris were ruled out for being too rocky and windy.</p>\\n\\n<p>That left the 81-mile long, 17-mile-wide (130-kilometer-long, 27-kilometer-wide) landing ellipse on the western edge of a flat, smooth expanse of lava plain.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"If you were a Martian coming to explore Earth\\'s interior like we are exploring Mars\\' interior, it wouldn\\'t matter if you put down in the middle of Kansas or the beaches of Oahu,\" said Banerdt. \"While I\\'m looking forward to those first images from the surface, I am even more eager to see the first data sets revealing what is happening deep below our landing pads. The beauty of this mission is happening below the surface. Elysium Planitia is perfect.\"</p>\\n\\n<p>After a 205-day journey that began on May 5, NASA\\'s InSight mission will touch down on Mars on Nov. 26 a little before 3 p.m. EST (12 p.m. PST). Its solar panels will unfurl within a few hours of touchdown. Mission engineers and scientists will take their time assessing their \"workspace\" prior to deploying SEIS and HP<sup>3</sup> on the surface &ndash; about three months after landing &ndash; and begin the science in earnest.</p>\\n\\n<p>InSight was the 12th selection in NASA\\'s series of Discovery-class missions.

       "  'body': '<p>Every Mars landing is a knuckle-whitening feat of engineering. But each attempt has its own quirks based on where a spacecraft is going and what kind of science the mission intends to gather.</p>\\n\\n<p>On Nov. 26, NASA will try to safely set a new spacecraft on Mars. InSight is a lander dedicated to studying the deep interior of the planet &ndash; the first mission ever to do so.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here are a few things to know about InSight\\'s landing.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>Landing on Mars is hard</b></p>\\n\\n<p>Only about 40 percent of the missions ever sent to Mars &ndash; by any space agency &ndash; have been successful. The U.S. is the only nation whose missions have survived a Mars landing. The thin atmosphere &ndash; just 1 percent of Earth\\'s &ndash; means that there\\'s little friction to slow down a spacecraft. Despite that, NASA has had a long and successful track record at Mars. Since 1965, it has flown by, orbited, landed on and roved across the surface of the Red Planet.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\\'column-width embedded_video video_player_container\\'>\\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDSbUpmRksI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<figcaption>\\nWhen NASA&rsquo;s InSight descends to the Red Planet on Nov. 26, 2018, it is guaranteed to be a white-knuckle event. Rob Manning, chief engineer at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explains the critical steps that must happen in perfect sequence to get the robotic lander.\\n</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<p><b>InSight uses tried-and-true technology</b></p>\\n\\n<p>In 2008, NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, successfully landed the Phoenix spacecraft at Mars\\' North Pole. InSight is based on the Phoenix spacecraft, both of which were built by Lockheed Martin Space in Denver. Despite tweaks to its heat shield and parachute, the overall landing design is still very much the same: After separating from a cruise stage, an aeroshell descends through the atmosphere. The parachute and retrorockets slow the spacecraft down, and suspended legs absorb some shock from the touchdown.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>InSight is landing on \"the biggest parking lot on Mars\"</b></p>\\n\\n<p>One of the benefits of InSight\\'s science instruments is that they can record equally valuable data regardless of where they are on the planet. That frees the mission from needing anything more complicated than a flat, solid surface (ideally with few boulders and rocks). For the mission\\'s team, the landing site at Elysium Planitia is sometimes thought as \"the biggest parking lot on Mars.\"</p>\\n\\n<p><b>InSight was built to land in a dust storm</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight&rsquo;s engineers have built a tough spacecraft, able to touch down safely in a dust storm if it needs to. The spacecraft\\'s heat shield is designed to be thick enough to withstand being \"sandblasted\" by dust. Its parachute has suspension lines that were tested to be stronger than Phoenix\\'s, in case it faces more air resistance due to the atmospheric conditions expected during a dust storm.</p>\\n\\n<p>The entry, descent and landing sequence also has some flexibility to handle shifting weather. The mission team will be receiving daily weather updates from NASA\\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in the days before landing so that they can tweak when InSight\\'s parachute deploys and when it uses radar to find the Martian surface.</p>\\n\\n<p><b>After landing, InSight will provide new science about rocky planets</b></p>\\n\\n<p>InSight will teach us about the interior of planets like our own. The mission team hopes that by studying the deep interior of Mars, we can learn how other rocky worlds, including Earth and the Moon, formed. Our home planet and Mars were molded from the same primordial stuff more than 4.5 billion years ago but then became quite different. Why didn&rsquo;t they share the same fate?</p>\\n\\n<p>When it comes to rocky planets, we&rsquo;ve only studied one in detail: Earth. By comparing Earth\\'s interior to that of Mars, InSight\\'s team members hope to better understand our solar system. What they learn might even aid the search for Earth-like exoplanets, narrowing down which ones might be able to support life. So while InSight is a Mars mission, it&rsquo;s also much more than a Mars mission.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can read more about how the science of the mission is unique <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8313/seven-ways-mars-insight-is-different/?site=insight\">here</a>.
